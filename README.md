# Game Server

A simple Express server with PlayFab integration for user authentication and token exchange, built with TypeScript.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Update the `SECRET_API_KEY` in `src/server.ts` with your actual API key.

3. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

Or for development with auto-restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will run on port 1111.
